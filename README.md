The GitHub repository hosts a compelling project showcasing an intelligent agent designed to master the classic Snake game through reinforcement learning techniques. 
This project is developed using Python and PyTorch.
The agent navigates the Snake game environment, progressively learning optimal strategies to achieve higher scores.
The core of the repository lies in the reinforcement learning algorithms implemented with PyTorch, empowering the agent to make informed decisions based on past experiences. 
The Python programming language serves as the backbone for the game's logic, while PyTorch facilitates the training and decision-making processes.
The project not only serves as an educational resource for those interested in reinforcement learning but also stands as a testament to the fusion of AI and gaming. 
The combination of Python, PyTorch, and the Snake game provides an engaging and accessible platform for enthusiasts to delve into the realm of artificial intelligence and witness the learning journey of the agent firsthand.
